# AoC 2024 Day 2

For the first problem, it was simple and I neglected the "strictly" in the increasing and decreasing checks. Luckily it didn't have the edge cases.

For the second problem, I refactored into functions to be met as there are some increasing-then-decreasing lists.

I tried to get GitHub co-pilot to create these small functions and focused on getting the logic to the question right. This seems much faster than writing and testing the sub-functions myself.
